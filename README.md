# Plant Disease Detection

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a Plant Disease Detection project. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect various diseases in plants using image processing and classification techniques.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Methods for cleaning and preparing plant images for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Scripts for training machine learning models to recognize different plant diseases.
- **Evaluation**: Tools for evaluating model performance and accuracy.
- **Prediction**: Code for using the trained model to make predictions on new images.
